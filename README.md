# cxxtemplate
A generic template for cxx-type applications.

## Guidelines
### KISS - Keep It Simple (and) Stupid!
This is really only to function at an extremely barebones level, i.e. the ability to compile a simple "Hello, World!" program on Windows and Unix.  It shall not turn into a convoluted and specialized can of worms.  If anything, it should be comprehensible at an educational level, even.

It should function as a simple template to branch out into other programs.

### Why the SDL library check?
Really as an example, if anything.  Also, for me at least, I chose SDL for making simple graphical programs.

### .vscode?
keeping for now, but might remove.
